# Raytracer in Python
![alt text](https://github.com/stakikawa/python-ray-tracer/blob/master/Output/image.png?raw=true)

This is a ray tracer built in Python based on [_Ray Tracing in One Weekend_](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html), which is written in C++. The first iteration is built with Python using nothing other than standard library tools for the sake of experience. For this reason, the code runs VERY slow to render images. I am  working on a second iteration using NumPy/PyTorch for a speed improvement.
